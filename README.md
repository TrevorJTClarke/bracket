# bracket
A quick setup of bracket championships.

#### Notes:

To view, simply load the `index.html` file in your browser.

All working source files are in the `public` folder.

All distribution files are in the `dist` folder.

### Project Setup

`npm install --save dev` - This will install all the local node_modules needed.

`grunt dev` - This will run the compiler, so as files change they get auto-compiled.

#### NOTE: If node is not installed, please do so before running npm commands.
